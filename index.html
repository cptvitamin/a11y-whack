# ```&ltcanvas&gt```<br>Accessibility Challenges

---
# What is ```&lt;canvas&gt;```?

.pull-left[
## Canvas is:

A 2D drawing API that includes drawing functions for rendering interactive bitmap images

]
.pull-right[
## What is it Good For?

* Graphs
* Animations
* Games
* Image Manipulation
]

* Appeared in OS X in 2004
* Appeared in WHAT WG spec in 2006

class: left-center

.left-column[
# Challenge #1

]

.right-column[

## No content to interact with

```html
&ltcanvas id="magic"
  width="350" height="196"&gt
```

# Solution #1

![Extreme Trustfall: Cartoon character falling backwards of the roof of a tall building](extreme-trust.png)
]

.right-column[

## Fallback content

```html
&ltcanvas id="magic"
  width="350" height="196"&gt
  &lt;h1&gt;Magic trick&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Find a unicorn&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Coax it under
        your coat tails&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Misdirect audience

        sneeze on first row?)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Reveal unicorn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt/canvas&gt
```
]

---

# Fallback Content

* Solution has been around since 2010
* Well supported by browsers and <span aria-label"Assistive technology" title="assistive technology">AT</span>
* Solution was in HTML5, not in ```&lt;canvas&gt;```

.pull-left[

## Pros

* Useful if author wants to provide a text alternative for canvas content

]

.pull-right[

## Cons

* Not programmatically linked with the ```&lt;canvas&gt;``` itself

]

---
class: left-center

.left-column[
# Challenge #2
]

.right-column[

## No association between pixels/paths and fallback elements

* Anything drawn to ```&lt;canvas&gt;``` is just a bitmap/pixels
* No programmatic relationship between those pixels and fallback elements
* No way to inform AAPIs of the location of those pixels
* No way to pass ```Events``` on the canvas to the associated fallback elements.

]

---
class: left-center

.left-column[
# Solution #2
]

.right-column[

## Hit Regions

* Defines the 'hit region list'
* ```addHitRegion(id, control)```
  * Method for associating a current path with a fallback element
* ```removeHitRegion(id)```
  * Removes a hit region from the 'hit region list'
* ```clearHitRegions()```
  * Removes all hit regions from the 'hit region list'
* Defines how MouseEvents are handled

]

---
class: left-center

.left-column[
# Challenge #3

![A square with cross hair indicators at the mid point of each side](focus.png)
]

.right-column[

## No visual focus indicators

* Focus indicators are crucial for anyone using a keyboard
* No (supported) standard method for indicating focus in HTML5 ```&lt;canvas&gt;```
* Without standard/easy method of doing so, authors are unlikely to roll their own.

]

---
class: left-center

.left-column[
# Solution #3
]

.right-column[

## ```drawFocusIfNeeded(element)```

* New method with a new name
* Draws a focus indicator around the current path if the fallback element associated with that path currently has focus.
* Scrolls current path into view if path is off screen (not beyond bounds of canvas)
* Informs Accessibility API of the location of the currently focused element.

# Building an Accessible Game using HTML5 Canvas

---

# Challenges

* I'm **NOT** a game designer
* The game needs to use all of these new features...
* ...that were implemented two weeks ago
* The game needs to showcase the accessibility benefits of these new features
* *there will be no googling for techniques or error messages*
* I'll need to design/build/test in one week

.center[.blue[**This will be no "[Call of Duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty)"**]]

---

# Guiding Principles

Game should be:

* Useable by keyboard users
* Useable by screen reader users
* Useable by screen magnification users
* Equally challenging for all

---

# Whac-a-mole

* Easy enough...
* Simple enough concept.
* Should allow me to showcase new features and satisfy all my guiding principles

---

# Deviations from Whac-a-mole

* There will be two characters rather than one
  * One is bad and should be "Whacked" (+10 points)
  * The other is good and should not be "Whacked" (-10 points)
* Fixed number of opportunities to score (10)
* We're not whacking moles here
  * My daughter suggested characters from her favorite video game, [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)
  * I agreed since they would be relatively easy to draw using ```&lt;canvas&gt;```
  * We chose "[Creepers](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creeper)" (*bad*) and "[Steve](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Steve)" (*good*)
* Game will be called "Whac a creeper, not a Steve"

---

# Game play

* Player moves focus to, and then activates Start button
* Characters randomly appear on the board, pausing between each
* Player either clicks or hits "Enter" key on Creepers to score 10 points
* Game ends when 10 Creepers have appeared on the board

# The Board

```html
&lt;canvas id=&quot;game&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;status&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; aria-live=&quot;aggressive&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;00&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;01&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;02&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;oob&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Out of Bounds!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;p aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;Score: &lt;span id=&quot;score&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
```

---
# Draw the character

* Game starts
* A random character is drawn in one of 9 grids
* A transparent hit region is drawn over the character and associated with corresponding fallback element
* That element is made focusable (tabindex=0)
* That element's text content is updated with the name of that character
* Focus is moved to a neutral location

---
# Drawing the character

Drawing squares in ```&lt;canvas&gt;``` is easy

```javascript
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle = color;
ctx.rect(x, y, 5, 5);
ctx.fill();
// color grid for creeper
var creeper = [
[&quot;#7D9C79&quot;, &quot;#008000&quot;, &quot;#348828&quot;, ... &quot;#366B36&quot;],
[&quot;#599A4C&quot;, &quot;#7D9C79&quot;, &quot;#62A853&quot;, ... &quot;#789776&quot;],
[&quot;#008000&quot;, &quot;#292929&quot;, &quot;#2B2B2B&quot;, ... &quot;#366B36&quot;],
[&quot;#348828&quot;, &quot;#2D2D2D&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;, ... &quot;#93939C&quot;],
...
[&quot;#789776&quot;, &quot;#7D9C79&quot;, &quot;#4A4A4A&quot;, ... &quot;#62A853&quot;],
];
```
---
# Steve!
.center[
<canvas id="steve" width="400" height="400">
<p>A rendering of Steve from Minecraft.  Minecraft characters are composed of 3d grids of solid colored blocks, so Steve's face, shown here in 2d is an 8 x 8 grid of colored squares.</p>
</canvas>
]
---
# Player takes action (or not)

* Player clicks on character *or*
* Uses Tab key to move focus to that character and press the Enter key
* If player is using a screenreader, the name of the character will be read aloud when focus is moved to it
* Score is calculated and updated
* If player does not take action, the game times out and the board is refreshed

---
class: title, center, middle

# Accessibility

---
# Hit Regions

* Each time a character is drawn on the grid, a transparent square is drawn over the character.
* A Hit Region associates that square with the corresponding ```&lt;div&gt;```
* Accessibility APIs are informed of the location of that region as if it were the location of the fallback element
* The player's screen will move to that location if the player is using magnification software
---
# Hit Region Script

```html
// draw a button and assign a Hit Region to it
function drawButton( text, id ) {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.fillStyle = "green";
  ctx.rect( 0, 0, 100, 30 );
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.addHitRegion(
    { id: id,
      control: document.getElementById(id)
    });
}
```
---
# ```drawFocusIfNeeded(element)```

Whever a focus change event occurs, the ```drawFocusIfNeeded()``` method is invoked and an indicator, consistent with the default focus indicator for the browser and operating system is drawn on the canvas.

* Focus change events
  * Mouse click on a Hit Region
  * Tab press
  * Clear grid/Reset board

---
# Draw Focus Script

I called this function whenever I drew a path to the Canvas that was associated with a fallback element and I wanted to move focus to it.

```javascript
function drawFocus( elem ){
  elem.focus();
  ctx.drawFocusIfNeeded( elem );
}
```

# Let's play!

* This game only works in [Firefox Nightly ](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) 31.0a1+ *with* ```canvas.focusrings.enabled``` and ```canvas.hitregions.enabled``` set to **true**
* It is currently short on features (Game Over, Play again, grid and speed adjustments, etc.)
* Only limited testing with speech and magnification
